          Samba is in excellent condition and well suited to sailing along the coast of Barcelona because she needs little wind.
          The sailboat is very light for its length of only 2500 kg. comparable sailboats of its size can weigh up to as much as 1000 kg more. The boat is main driven (33m2) with a 105% Genoa. She was designed as a one design racer and became very
          popular in France where she still is used in many races.

        <p id="rivalInfoPara">There are alternative options of reaching port Badalona and finding the boat.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Taxi - The quickest and easiest way to find us without much walking involved is by taxi. Simply ask the driver for port Badalona, gate B
          </li>
          <li>Metro - The purple line (L2) Sant Roc, Gorg, Pep Ventura and Badalona Pompeu Fabra. The latter is located right in Badalona's city centre and is a good 25 minutes walk back towards the port. Gate B will be on the far side near the
            chinese
            restaurant</li>
          <li>Train - If you are close to the stations by either the 'Arc de Triomph' or 'El Clot', this is your best public transport option. The line you need is (R1). The train travels along the coast so you will pass the port just before you
            arrive
            at the train station of Badalona, which is by the sea. It is a pleasant 15 minute walk back to the port along the beach, and gate B will be on the far side near the chinese restaurant
          </li>
          <li>Tram - The T4 line that runs from Ciutadella/Vila Olímpica to Sant Adrià de Besos every few minutes. Once the tram has completed it's journey you must carry on walking in the same direction of travel for approximately 15 minutes to
            arrive
            at the port. Turn right after the roundabout to find gate B</li>

        <p id="para">
          At Sailing Barcelona we take time to work with our clients to make sure we understand their expectations and requirements in each and every way prior to an agreement taking place.
          Our aim is to make every contract straightforward with clear pricing information and to ensure that every delivery is carried out professionally.
          On delivery passages we supply a minimum of 3 crew depending on the vessel size and complexity, that are all RYA qualified instructors and skippers to ensure your peace of mind. We also ensure that when delivering new vessels from
          boatyards that our skippers have the necessary experience.

      <div class="">
        <p id="para">
          On joining a vessel our crew spend as much time is necessary checking all the boat’s systems and preparing the boat for passage, even for short deliveries.
          This includes a detailed checklist covering the function of more than a hundred items of equipment and fittings from pushpit to pulpit, bilge to masthead. Anything that is not serviceable and might have an effect on the delivery passage
          will be reported on, and rectified if practical, before setting out. All vulnerable areas of woodwork and upholstery below decks are encased in protective cladding to avoid any inadvertent damage while at sea in rough conditions. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="">
        <p id="para">
          Once underway the skippers establish and maintain a rate of progress towards the destination to complete the passage in the budgeted timescale. For sail boats, this progress will be under sail, however if the wind dies then the engine will
          be used to ensure that the delivery is not delayed. Owners are welcome to join a delivery although the delivery crew will routinely sail 24 hours a day with only brief stops as necessary for fuel, provisions or to avoid severe weather.
          Safety is always the first priority and the skipper’s judgement at sea is never questioned. If the skipper decides that the conditions are too rough to proceed then the yacht will head for shelter. The level of experience and sailing
          expertise required of our skippers allows them to make good progress in conditions of wind and sea that would keep most leisure sailors firmly in their bunks on dry land. Our policy is to sail conservatively and not over-stress sails, rigs
          or engines.
          On completion of all deliveries the Skipper completes a detailed condition report on the vessel and its’ systems so that owners have a picture of their boat’s condition on arrival. We never forget how important your boat is to you and
          ensure that you are kept informed of progress during the passage. We organize every aspect of the delivery passage and there is no requirement for a formal handover from the owner or his representative.</p>
