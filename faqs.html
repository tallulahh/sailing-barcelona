      <div class="left">
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Where do the tours start and when should I arrive?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Our boat is moored in the Port Olympic harbor at pontoon 7. Please arrive 5 to 10 minutes prior to our agreed start time so that we can great you at the gate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Where do we keep our stuff during the activity?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Please only bring with you what you will need on the sailing trip if possible. We do have space inside the boat but this is limited
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What should I bring?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p> Any sun protection you might need (hat, glasses and cream)
          Camera
          Swimming clothes, just in case conditions allow
          Anything else you would normally take on a normal day/night out in case you want to visit a restaurant after the sailing trip
          An extra layer of warm clothing even if it is hot on the day as temperatures can drop by 10 degrees in the shade and out on the water. For the sunset sailing trips, please bring a jacket as the trip will start out warm but will be quite
          cool towards the end
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What route will we be doing?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Your skipper will choose a route for your trip based on the wind direction and sea conditions, to make the sailing trip as comfortable as possible. This could be along the coast towards Badalona, towards the commercial port or straight
          out for a panoramic view of the city.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: How many people go on your tours?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>We are conducting mostly private sailing tours. Any numbers are possible from 2 to 8 people on the Rival 38 and from 2 to 12 people on the Pearson 424. If you have an inquiry regarding a larger group simply drop us email with your
          requirements and we will make the necessary arrangements on your behalf. This may lead to the use of other sailing trip vendors.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Will we get wet?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          There maybe an occasional splash from a rogue wave or the wake from a large passing boat, as we are in the sea after all, but generally you only get wet if you want to jump into the Mediterranean to cool off from the summer sun.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Can we join another group?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Most trips are private and it is not possible to join with other groups. However, please get in touch and we can see if we can sort something out.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Can we bring food or drinks with us?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes! You can bring anything you like. We do provide 2 drinks of water, coca cola or beer for every person onboard. If you would like us to provide something more substantial like a bottle of Cava or wine and some local tapas, please let
          us know at least 48 hours in advance so we can prepare for this. This is currently priced as €15 per person for tapas and €20 for a bottle of Cava.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What about smoking?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p> Usually this is ok but not a given as fire and sails don't mix. All guests onboard the boat must be in full agreement to others smoking. Just please never ever throw your cigarette ends into the sea. No smoking inside the boat.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What footwear should we wear?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Something comfortable and practical like non marking sports shoes, sandals or sailing shoes. High heels should be avoided, both for your own safety, and to prevent damaging the wooden decks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Can we stop for a swim / snorkel?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes! If the sea is calm enough. It usually is in the morning sailing trips, or later in the sunset trips that provide the best swimming conditions. It should be warm enough for the braver swimmers in late May. The rest of us might prefer
          to wait until mid-June for the temperature to rise a little more.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Can we play music?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We like to appreciate the peace and tranquility of being on the open sea. But of course we want you to enjoy your sailing trip just as you wish, so on the Rival 38 we do provide bluetooth speakers for your own use. This may or may not be
          possible on the Pearson 424.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Do we need to know anything about sailing?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Absolutely not for sailing with us, but on the Rival 38 a minimum of 3 hours sailing experience on a boat less than 30ft is required. The skipper can do the sailing as you wish, while you do the relaxing! But if you do want to get
          involved in sailing the boat and become a part of the crew, that’s fine as well.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: How fit do we need to be?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>The cruise is a relaxing trip, not a work-out, so fitness isn’t an issue. If you have any problems with mobility, let us know, and we will arrange to collect you from the fuel dock, where you can simply step aboard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Is there a toilet on board?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, but it can be a bit of a challenge with the boat moving through the waves! It is certainly best to go before the trip or ask the skipper as soon as you arrive so that they can let you into the local facilities at the port.        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What about seasickness?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Our boat is very stable due to the classic design, but if you are sensitive to motion sickness, we recommend a medicine called “Stugeron” (generic name – Cinnarizine). You can get it over the counter at any pharmacy. Take one tablet about
          an hour before sailing. If you do feel queasy on the boat, the best advice is to lie on your back and close your eyes for a few minutes. It works wonders for most people. We recommend that you not to drink heavily the night before a
          sailing trip, don't eat heavy fried food prior to a trip and keep well hydrated. If you get car sick or feel this is a concern for you get in contact with us here so we can give you the best possible prevention techniques. Another great
          natural remedy for seasickness is to eat ginger. This can be taken in many forms hours prior to the trip and also during the sailing trip.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Who will be taking me on the tour?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          One of our qualified and experienced RYA skippers and crew.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What are the age restrictions?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          We don't have any age restrictions, and have safety gear onboard to cater for everyone. If there will be more than 1 small child on the trip, please let us know in as much advance as possible.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Where is your office in Barcelona?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          We are an office-less company, that way we keep our overheads low and can pass these savings onto you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: What is your cancellation policy?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          We understand that whilst traveling plans can change and that you may need to cancel your tours. If you wish to cancel 7 days prior to your trip we will offer a 90% refund. The 10% is to cover the administration costs of booking. If you
          need to cancel within 48 hours of your trip we will offer a 50% refund, unless we can fill your place with an alternative trip. If we manage to fill your place successfully we will offer a 90% refund. Depending on your situation we may be
          able to reschedule your booking for another day, depending on availability. We will do our best to work with you in this instance.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: When do you cancel tours for weather?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          We do not cancel tours due to overcast skies but we do cancel trips for steady rain, especially strong wind, thunderstorms or any weather the skipper feels is dangerous. If you have booked a sailing trip, we will firstly try to call you,
          then email you if contact hasn't been made. if we are canceling the trip due to weather and give you a choice of either rescheduling (depending on availability) or receiving a full refund. We will do this as soon as we know the tour will
          be cancelled, however, this can sometimes not be until the tour is about to begin as weather and sea conditions can change very quickly. We must stress though that the final decision is made by a professional skipper on the day in the port
          as weather conditions can differ greatly from inland in the city to what is happening out on the sea.
        </p>

      <div class="bold">
        <p>Q: Do I need to tip my guide?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          No, only if you want to and feel that it’s deserved. Tips are never expected, but always appreciated.</p>
